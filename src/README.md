##About The App
Transit is a single page application developed with React

##Technologies Used
Project is created with
React
SCSS
Typescript

##Setup/Installation
To run this project, install it locally using npm
Download or clone the repository
Run npm install
Run npm dev

##Approach
I created the application using vite. I took into consideration coercion and separation of concerns while architecting my project folder. I created common components which I used as basic building blocks for my application. I used SCSS to make my stylesheet more structured and maintainable. I used Typescript to evade errors and to make my rewrites more easier. I used react router for my routing.

##Difficulties
The design had a lot of components for a single-page application which took a lot more of my time. The design also had a lot of inconsistencies which made it harder to implement the design
